## Repository structure

```
agent/                 Python LangGraph agent (FastAPI + Lakebase)
  agent_server/            Agent code, tools, evaluation
  e2e-chatbot-app-next/    Next.js + React chat UI (TypeScript monorepo)
  databricks.yml           Databricks Asset Bundle config
config/                    Workspace resource pointers
```

Per-component setup, run, and deploy instructions live in:

- [`agent/README.md`](./agent/README.md) — Python agent
- [`agent/agent_server/README.md`](./agent/agent_server/README.md) — agent internals
- [`back/README.md`](./back/README.md) — chat UI

## Development workflow

### Python agent (`agent/`)

```bash
cd agent
uv run quickstart        # one-time setup
uv run start-app         # local dev server
```

### Chat UI (`back/`)

```bash
cd back
./scripts/quickstart.sh  # one-time setup
npm run dev              # local dev server
```

### Deploy (Databricks Asset Bundle)

```bash
cd agent
databricks bundle deploy
databricks bundle run agent_langgraph
```

## Code style and linting

- **Python**: managed by `uv`. Format and type-check before submitting.
- **TypeScript**: linted and formatted with [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) (not
  ESLint/Prettier).
  - `npm run lint` (auto-fixes)
  - `npm run format`

## Testing

- **Python**: `pytest` from `agent/`.
- **TypeScript**: `npm test` from `back/`
  (Playwright + MSW). Run tests locally before opening a PR.

## Pull request process

1. Open the PR against `main`.
2. Keep the change scoped — one logical change per PR.
3. Update the relevant `README.md` files when behavior changes.
4. Make sure linters and tests pass locally.
5. Request review from a `CODEOWNERS` member.
6. After review and CI pass, a maintainer will merge.

## Commit messages

Concise, imperative mood. Reference the affected component when useful, e.g.
`agent_server: pin checkpointer to dedicated schema`.
